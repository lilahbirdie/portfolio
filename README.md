### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced receptionist and customer service professional with over 3 years of proven expertise in customer service and veterinary medicine.

With skills in concise and clear communication, POS, client account management, and technological troubleshooting, I can serve customers through difficult times and achieve customer satisfaction. I am adept at using EzyVet, Smartflow/Whiteboard, and Cornerstone.

My extensive skill set, commitment to client satisfaction and retention, and passion for education make me a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to draw and go on hikes.
